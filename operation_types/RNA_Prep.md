#This protocol is for total RNA QC.  It Will take in a batch of samples, replate these
#samples together onto a 96 well plate that will then go through a QC protocols including
#getting the concentrations of the original sampole.  These concentrations will then be associated
#with the original sample for use later.


#Currently build plate needs a bit of work.  It works by order of input array and not by order of sample location on plate
